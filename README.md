# Pokemon Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains Python code for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Pokémon dataset. The analysis includes the following components:

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for creating basic visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and histograms.
- **Seaborn**: Used for creating more advanced statistical visualizations like boxplots and heatmaps.

## Graphs Generated

1. **Bar Chart of Pokemon Types with Average Total Stats**: Visualizes the average total stats of Pokémon for each type.
2. **Scatter Plot of Attack vs. Defense**: Shows the relationship between Attack and Defense stats of Pokémon.
3. **Pie Chart of Legendary vs. Non-Legendary Pokémon**: Displays the distribution of Legendary and Non-Legendary Pokémon in the dataset.
4. **Boxplot of Total Stats by Pokemon Type**: Illustrates the distribution of Total stats for each Pokémon type.
5. **Histogram of Pokémon Generations**: Represents the distribution of Pokémon across different generations.

## Methods Used

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation to summarize the dataset.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Computed the correlation matrix to understand relationships between Pokémon stats.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Analyzed the frequency distribution of Pokémon types and generations.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Examined the distribution of numerical attributes using histograms and density plots.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis, clone this repository and run the Python scripts provided. Make sure to have the required libraries installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aarish22/EDA_Pokemon.git
